## VAT protocols

The VAT protocols are created from page „Purchase VAT protocols" and „Sales VAT protocols". The posted protocols could be found in pages „Posted Purchase VAT protocols" and „Posted Sales VAT Protocols".

You can see them in the **Accountant** role center:

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image6.png" width="627" height="244" />

### VAT Protocols Setup

In **General ledger setup** the number series for VAT protocols and posted VAT protocols are set up in fileds VAT Protocol Nos. and Posted VAT Protocol Nos.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image7.png" width="518" height="336" />

In **Purchase and Payables setup** the VAT Business posting group for VAT protocols is set up in field EU VAT Bus.Posting Group

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image8.png" width="595" height="363" />

In **Sales and Receivables setup** the VAT Business posting group for VAT protocols is set up in field EU VAT Bus.Posting Group

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image9.png" width="627" height="324" />

### Creation of VAT purchase protocols

To create a new VAT purchase protocol, go to **VAT reporting- Purchase VAT protocols**

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image10.png" width="627" height="114" />

To create a new protocol, Choose **New.**

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image11.png" width="627" height="108" />

Choose vendor and press Enter, so that a new protocol to be created.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image12.png" width="627" height="413" />

Choose **Copy document**, and choose the document, from which the protocol should be created. Several options are available:

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image13.png" width="321" height="315" />

-   **Posted VAT protocol** -- copy from a posted VAT protocol
-   **Posted invoice** -- copy from a posted purchase invoice
-   **Posted credit memo** -- copy from a posted purchase credit memo
-   **Ledger entries** -- copy from entries, created in **General journal**.

**Include header** -- mark this field, if the data from the selected document header have to be used. If **Ledger entries** is selected, the header has to be filled in manually.
**Compress lines** -- if the field is not marked, the lines of the posted document are copied to the protocol. If the field is marked, the lines are compressed into one line.

After the document is selected, press OK and the data is filled in the protocol.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image14.png" width="627" height="473" />

In the VAT protocol header, fill in **Composed by** and **Ground for issue.**

VAT protocols can be created for several documents. In order to use this functionality, from the list of the protocols choose the button Create Purch. VAT protocol.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image15.png" width="627" height="161" />

In the window that opens, fill in the following fields:

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image16.png" width="496" height="531" />

-   **Document date -** enter the VAT protocol document date. Valid for all protocols that will be issued.
-   **Posting date** -- enter the VAT protocol posting date. Valid for all protocols that will be issued.
-   **VAT date** -- if left empty, the field will be filled in with the date of the copied posted document
-   **Create from invoices** -- if this option is marked, the system will create the invoices from the posted purchase invoices
-   **Create from credit memos** -- if this option is marked, the system will create the invoices from the posted purchase credit memos
-   **New protocol per document** -- when selecting this option, separate protocols will be created for each invoice / credit memo. Otherwise, the system will summarize the invoices and CMs for each vendor in one protocol.
-   **Compress lines** -- if this option is checked, the system will summarize all lines of the invoice or CM in one line. Otherwise, all lines of the source document will be copied to the protocol.

**Vendor**, **Invoice** and **Credit Memo** help to further filter the documents. For example, you can specify in the Filter **Vendor,** VAT business posting group with the value that applicable for EU suppliers (VEND EU). This will filter only those documents that are from EU vendors.

Once the protocols are posted, in the list of posted invoices and credit memos, the system automatically marks the documents for which VAT protocols are issued. This avoids the re-generation of protocols for these documents.

### VAT combinations in VAT protocols

The VAT combination defines in which columns of the VAT ledgers the protocol will be included.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image17.png" width="627" height="172" />

When the combination is with classification code 08, the protocol is included in the VAT purchase ledger in columns 10 and 11, and in VAT sales ledger in columns 9, 10, 13, 15.

When the combination is with classification code 02, the protocol is included in the VAT purchase ledger in columns 10 and 11, and in VAT sales ledger in columns 9, 10, 14, 15.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image18.png" width="627" height="184" />

When the protocol has to be included in the VAT purchase ledger with no VAT refund, and the VAT amount has to be included in this sum, it is necessary to select a combination, that has VAT classification codes 98 and 92, for which "No refund" is selected. In this case only for these two codes the amount, including the VAT amount, will be included in the VAT purchase ledger. The columns in the VAT sales ledger are similar to those for code 02 and 08.

### VAT protocol included only in the VAT Sales Ledger

When a VAT protocol should be registered only in the VAT Sales Ledger we can use the functionality of VAT for private use of assets, described in this document. The protocol will be included only in the VAT Sales Ledger. It is necessary to set a new VAT combination, which should be marked for personal use, as well as the protocol itself to be marked as a protocol for personal use of assets.

### Voiding VAT Protocol

When the VAT protocol has to be voided, go to the posted VAT protocol, choose Actions - Functions- Void.

Reversing GL entries are posted, and the protocol is included in the VAT ledgers with 0 amounts.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image19.png" width="524" height="382" />

### Reversing VAT protocol (credit protocol)

When you create a reversing VAT protocol, the field Correction has to be marked. When the protocol is created from a posted purchase credit memo, the field is marked automatically.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image20.png" width="627" height="193" />

## VAT on customs declaration

VAT on customs declaration is posted in General Journal. In the General Journal, fill in the following fields:
-   **GL account -** select the account for VAT on purchase
-   **Posting date**
-   **SAD No.** - Customs declaration number
-   **General posting type** -- Purchase;
-   **Amount** -- amount of VAT on the customs declaration
-   **VAT subject** -- if not filled in, the transaction will be included with subject Purchase in the VAT purchase ledger
-   **VAT Business posting group**-- ZVAT MD (the VAT Business posting group for VAT on customs declarations);
-   **VAT product posting group** -- VAT20

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image21.png" width="627" height="174" />

In the VAT Posting Setup the VAT posting groups combination has to be set up as follows:
-   **VAT%** - 20;
-   **VAT calculation type** -- Full VAT;
-   **Transaction type** -- Purchase;
-   **Purchase VAT refund type** -- Full refund
-   **VAT classification code**- 00

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image22.png" width="539" height="293" />

In the VAT purchase ledger, the transaction is included as a document type 07.

## VAT ledgers and VAT declaration

In accordance with the Bulgarian tax law, the following VAT statutory reports are submitted to tax authorities on a monthly basis:
-   VAT declaration
-   VAT Purchase ledger
-   VAT Sales ledger
-   VIES Return

VAT purchase and sales ledgers are books, that include each taxable sales or purchase transaction with a posting date in the specified month, for which the ledgers are created.

VAT ledgers have a set of mandatory data that are to be entered for every transaction -- invoice number, document type, invoice date, customer/vendor name and VAT number, transaction description, VAT base, and VAT amount.

The sales/purchase document tax base amount and tax amount are included in different columns of the VAT ledgers, depending on the tax law articles compliance.

Some transactions should be excluded from VAT ledgers (e.g. purchases from non-EU countries, that are included in the VAT purchase ledger with the customs declaration number after posting the VAT on customs declaration).

### VAT ledgers creation

The posting date of the document defines in which monthly VAT ledgers the transaction will be included.

To create a new VAT ledger, go to the main menu of role center Accountant, section VAT Reporting.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image23.png" width="627" height="245" />

A new ledger can be created from the Purchase Ledger List or the Sales Ledger List page, and an existing ledger can also be viewed, edited, deleted, or printed.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image24.png" width="627" height="129" />

Creating a new ledger is done by selecting the action **New**. A window opens in which it is necessary to enter the first day of the respective month for which the ledger is created - in the field **Period** **Start date.**

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image25.png" width="627" height="248" />

Then it is necessary to select **Create**. When performing this action, the data is loaded in the lines of the ledger as in the screenshot below:

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image26.png" width="627" height="286" />

The entries included in the ledger are those that are posted in the system at the time of creating the ledger and their posting date is within the period for which the ledger is created. In case, after generating a ledger, more documents for the period are posted, it is necessary to generate the ledger again with the Create button.

The fields in the VAT ledger that provide information about the status of the ledger are the following:

• Created - indicates that the ledger has created rows with data from the posted documents.
• Exported - indicates whether the ledger data was exported in files for submission to the tax administration. A ledger marked as Exported cannot be changed.
• Status - indicates the status of the ledger: Open or Started. Status Open means that the Create action can be performed, and in case the ledger has already been created, the data in it can be changed. Status Started means that the ledger data cannot be changed and the Create action cannot be performed on it.

For each VAT ledger certain actions can be performed. You can find them in menu Actions - Functions.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image27.png" width="627" height="283" />

• **Create** - creates lines in the ledger with data from the posted documents. For one log, the action can be performed repeatedly. Each execution of the action removes the existing rows in the log and reloads them. In order for the action to be performed, the status of the ledger must be Open. Status Open for a ledger that has already acquired the status Started is obtained with the action Reopen.

In case the Create action is performed for a ledger that has the status Open, but is marked as Exported, then the system displays a warning message that the log has already been exported.

• **Check** - checks the created ledger for errors that would prevent the acceptance of the ledger by the tax administration. Example of error: Contragent ID field is not filled in.
• **Release** - changes the status of the ledger from Open to Released. For a ledger with Status Released, no changes can be made and the Create action cannot be performed.
• **Reopen** - changes the status of the ledger from Released to Open. Only for a ledger with the status Open, the Create action can be performed.

After a ledger is exported in a file with a format for submission to the tax administration (described in item 2.4.4. Creating VAT files), the ledger is automatically marked as Exported. In addition, in the ledger list and in the ledger itself, its status is changed to Released.

If corrections are needed in an already exported ledger, it must be opened again with the Reopen action, then re-created or corrected. Once the adjustments have been made, new VAT files should be created for the ledger.

When a ledger is selected, Statistics related to it is displayed on the right side of the screen, where summary information about the entries included in the ledger can be obtained.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image28.png" width="627" height="322" />

Using the Print action, the ledger can be displayed on a screen, printed on a printer, or saved as a file:

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image29.png" width="627" height="329" />

### VAT declaration creation

The VAT declaration is created from the main menu of the Accountant role center.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image30.png" width="627" height="123" />

A new declaration is created using the Create button. In the new line that appears in the list of declarations, the Period Start date - the first day of the declared month - must be entered. All fields for amounts in the lines of the declaration are filled in manually (not calculable), including the amounts of VAT for refund and deduction.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image31.png" width="627" height="92" />

The declaration is generated after the purchase and sales ledgers have been generated. To display the Declaration itself, it is necessary to select the **Print** button. The data for the person responsible for preparing and submitting the declaration are entered once and after printing the document on a printer or saving it in a file, they are saved and do not need to be entered for the next printing. It is necessary to mark that this person is a Representative of the company, as well as to indicate a Confirmation of correctness of the data. After this data is filled in, select View or Print.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image32.png" width="409" height="495" />

The report is visualized and from it you can see the amount of VAT to be paid or deducted. This amount must then be entered on the lines of the declaration (field VAT effectively paid).

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image33.png" width="594" height="714" />

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image34.png" width="516" height="713" />

### VIES declaration creation

The VIES declaration is created from the main menu of the Accountant role center.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image35.png" width="627" height="130" />

A new declaration is created using the **New** button.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image36.png" width="627" height="101" />

A new line appears in the list of declarations, in which the Period Start date must be entered - the first day of the declared month, as well as data about the employee responsible for preparing and submitting the declaration - ID, Name, Position (Authorized person, Procurator), Address.

The Print button opens a window in which the declaration is prepared for printing.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image37.png" width="345" height="370" />

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image38.png" width="624" height="658" />

### VAT ledgers export

VAT files are created on the VAT Ledgers Export page. For the role center Accountant, it is located in the main menu, in the VAT Reporting section.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image39.png" width="627" height="190" />

In the page opened, you can specify:
• Period - month and year for which data is exported
• Ledgers and declarations for which files will be created
• The names of the files to be created

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image40.png" width="414" height="466" />

The fields for the file names are filled in automatically with values, according to the requirements for their submission to the tax administration:
-   PRODAGBI.TXT -- VAT Sales ledger
-   POKUPKI.TXT -- VAT Purchase ledger
-   DEKLAR.TXT - VAT declaration
-   VIES.TXT - VIES Declaration

By selecting the OK button for each ledger or declaration specified for export, separate files are created. A message for successful creation of each of the files is displayed and they can be found in the download folder of the user's computer:

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image41.png" width="627" height="309" />

Once the export files for the ledgers are generated, the system automatically marks these ledgers as Exported. Files for VAT ledgers and declarations can be generated repeatedly if necessary to correct the data.

## VAT for private use of assets

### **General terms of the VAT for private use of assets**

The rules for VAT for private use of assets are applied according to Art. 6, para. 3, item 1 and Art. 9, para. 3, item 1 of the VAT Act and the need for VAT registered companies to declare the tax on the assets used for personal needs when submitting the monthly declaration and the ledgers for purchases and sales to the tax administration.

The amount of the tax should be included in determining the result for the respective tax period in the monthly VAT declaration under Art. 125 for this tax period in cell 23 - Tax charged on supplies of goods or services for personal use.

When companies choose to use assets for personal needs, in Dynamics 365 Business Central it is necessary to follow the steps described below.

###  Setup of VAT Business and Product posting groups in VAT Posting Setup for VAT for private use of assets

In **VAT posting setup,** the following fields are set up:

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image42.png" width="627" height="123" />

The combination of the VAT business posting group and VAT product posting group has the following parameters:
-   **VAT calculation type -** full VAT
-   **VAT % -** 20**;**
-   **Sales VAT account --** xxxxx (the account for VAT on sales)
-   **Purchase VAT account --** xxxxx (an expense account for the VAT paid for private use of assets);
-   **Transaction type --** Sales;
-   **VAT classification code --** 01;
-   **Calculate VAT for personal use -** <img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image43.png" width="21" height="22" />

**Note:** When posting documents (VAT protocol) with this combination, the amount of VAT will be reflected in column 16 -- VAT charged for purchases of goods or services for personal needs of the Sales Ledger and in cell 23 - VAT charged for purchases of goods or services for personal needs of the VAT monthly declaration.

There must be no posting groups in the account card referred to as \"VAT Purchases Account\" in VAT Posting Setup.

### Setup in VAT Purchase Protocol

For incurring VAT for private use a VAT purchase protocol is created. In the VAT purchase protocol header a new field "Calculate VAT for personal use" is added.

This field should be marked, if the protocol is for VAT for private use. The protocol will be included in the VAT Sales Ledger only.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image44.png" width="518" height="252" />

In the VAT protocol lines the specific VAT Product posting group should be selected.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image45.png" width="553" height="106" />

**Note:** the system makes the following checks:
-   **The field "VAT for personal use" is checked in VAT posting groups combination (VAT posting setup)**;
-   **The field "VAT for personal use" is checked in the VAT purchase protocol header, tab General**

Only if these two fields are checked, the VAT protocol for VAT for personal use will be posted.

If only one of the fields is checked, the system displays a warning message for a discrepancy and does not allow posting until the discrepancy is rectified:

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image46.png" width="333" height="116" />

**Note:** When creating a **Purchase Protocol**, it is advisable that the **Copy document** function is used and the **Include Header** field is checked. Thus, the type and number of the copied document are recorded in the **Purchase Protocol** header, in the fields **Original Document Type** and **Original Document No.** The content of these fields cannot be edited subsequently. If **Copy document** does not use checking of the **Include Header** field, then the fields in the protocol remain blank and in the printed form of the protocol the field **To document / Date** remains blank as well.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image47.png" width="438" height="140" />

## Set up VAT Cash Regime 

The introduction of the VAT Cash Regime in the National Tax legislation is aimed at supporting small businesses that encounter difficulty to pay value added tax to the budget before they have received payment from their customers for the goods and services supplied by them.

The cash regime is applied in cases where there is a taxable supply at a rate of 20% VAT, payment is be made by bank transfer, the vendor and the recipient are registered pursuant to the Bulgarian VAT Act, and are not related parties.

The following steps should be followed to do the required setup in Dynamics 365 Business Central.

### General Setup

You need to search for and open the **General Ledger Setup** page.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image48.png" width="624" height="192" />

You must check the fields **Unrealized VAT** and **Prepayment Unrealized VAT**.

### Create new VAT Business Posting Group

After **Unrealized VAT** check box is selected, the **VAT Business Posting Groups** page opens.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image49.png" width="627" height="202" />

In the example below, the ZKasova group is created (the name is user-selectable). In the column **Article 151**, the group for cash payments must be checked.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image50.png" width="627" height="158" />

### Set up VAT Business Posting Groups 

The Setup button is selected and a new combination is created.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image51.png" width="503" height="129" />

In the column **Unrealized VAT Type**, the option **Percent** is filled in. In the column **Purchase VAT Unrealized Account**, VAT account for unrealized VAT is filled in.

The rest of the fields are filled in as in the case of standard charging of VAT:
-   **VAT %** - 20;
-   **VAT Calculation Type** -- VAT;
-   **Transaction type** -- Purchase;
-   **Purchase VAT Refund Type** -- Full refund
-   **VAT Clause Code** - 00

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image52.png" width="627" height="111" />

Once the VAT combination is set up, the new VAT business posting group must be entered in the card of Cash registered suppliers. Thus, for each purchase, the invoice will automatically load this VAT Business Posting Group and the system will identify the invoice and payments on it as Cash.

### Change a VAT Group in invoices when paying in cash

When an invoice is entered for supply by a vendor registered under this regime, and if it is a cash invoice, you need to consider it as a regular invoice. For this purpose, in the invoice you need to change the **VAT Business Posting Group** from the one indicated as VAT Cash Group, to one that is standard for Bulgarian vendors.

The above change is made in the header of the Purchase Order / Purchase Invoice in the **Invoice Details** section.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image53.png" width="443" height="184" />

From the list of **VAT Business Posting Groups** the required group is selected. After the group is changed, the program displays a warning message in which you must select \"Yes\".

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image54.png" width="284" height="116" />

**Note**: It is advisable to change the **VAT Business Posting Group** before you start populating the lines in the purchase order / invoice. If an account has already been entered along the lines, the amount will be deleted and you need to re-enter it. If an item has been entered and a manual correction has been made to the price or discount in the line, they must also be re-entered.

When posting a document, the system displays a warning message to prevent accidental error when groups are changed. If it is a cash payment, reply to the message with \"No\".

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image55.png" width="286" height="103" />

### **Reflect payments for invoices under Cash Regime** 

When an invoice is posted under the Cash regime, the VAT on it is posted to a separate account. When the Invoice is linked to the Payment, the amount is automatically transferred from this account to the VAT account. The date on which the transaction is posted is the date on which the payment is linked. The invoice can be linked to the payment before the Protocol for this payment has come. It is advisable that the linking should be made in the payment and not in the invoice.

### Enter protocols for payment of invoices under Cash Regime 

The protocol is entered from the **Vendor Ledger Entries** (**Vendor Card** - **Entries**). You must select the invoice for which a Protocol has been received. After you mark the invoice, you need to select the **Protocols input** option from the **Functions** button.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image56.png" width="626" height="262" />

All entries for payments of the respective invoice are displayed. In the fields **Protocol Date** and **Protocol No**. the date and number of the protocol must be entered. An invoice can be paid with several protocols. The protocols entered so far to the selected invoice will also be displayed in this screen.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image57.png" width="627" height="148" />

After you enter the date and number, you must close the screen. The protocol date must be within the month in which the entry was linked, otherwise the system will display an error message. The entry for the Protocol is reflected in the ledger in the month in which the entry is linked (date of accounting for VAT). In case of discrepancy in the months of linking and of protocol, you need to unlink the payment from the invoice and link it again with a date of the month in which the protocol was issued. The generation of the VAT ledgers and the VAT Monthly declaration is done in the standard way.

## VAT Setup when carrying out activities under Art. 163

According to the Bulgarian legislation, special VAT reverse charge schemes have been introduced when reflecting transactions involving waste and cereals and industrial crops. Reverse charging is a specific tax tool in which tax is charged by the recipient and not by the vendor. The mechanism requires that the tax is chargeable to the recipient in the transaction, who must be a VAT registered person, regardless of whether the vendor is a VAT registered person or not. In connection with these requirements in Dynamics 365 Business central, you need to make the following settings.

### Create new VAT Product Posting Groups 

You need to create new **VAT Product Posting Groups**. Using the search button we can find this page in the menu:

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image58.png" width="550" height="167" />

In the example below the groups VAT_GRAIN and WASTE are created.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image59.png" width="626" height="166" />

### Set up a combination of VAT groups in Sales

In **Posting Setup**, the following settings are made for the new groups:

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image60.png" width="626" height="118" />

A combination of a **VAT Business Posting Group** of customers from Bulgaria and the new **VAT Product Posting Groups** is selected. The fields are filled in as follows:
-   **VAT calculation type --** VAT
-   **VAT % -** 0
-   **Sales VAT Account --** xxxxx
-   **Transaction Type --** Sales
-   **Specific Purchase Art.163a --** 01 or 02
-   **VAT Classification Code --** 00

A new column **Specific Purchase Art.163a** has been added. Code 01 is entered against the combination for the sale of waste, and code 02 - against the sale of cereals.

|  Code  |  Description                                     |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
|  01    |  Supply under part I, appendix 2 of the VAT Act  |
|  02    |  Supply under part II, appendix 2 of the VAT Act |

When selling items that are included in this group, you need to change the **VAT Product Posting Group** in the item card. When you select income G/L account in the lines of the sales document, it is good to have an account with this kind of a **VAT Product Posting Group**. In case you decide to use the same account for the sale of taxable and non-taxable sales, then you need to change the **VAT Product Posting Group** in the lines of the Sales Order / Sales Invoice.

### Set up a combination of VAT groups in purchases

In this case, the tax is charged by the recipients of the supplies by issuing a protocol. The protocol may be common to all supplies for which the tax has become chargeable in the relevant tax period, when the suppliers are non-taxable physical persons. Invoices for reverse charge supplies must specify as a ground for issue \"reverse charge under Art. 163a (2) of the VAT Act\".

Reverse charge is not applied to Intra-Community supplies and acquisitions (supplies from and to Bulgarian persons with counterparties from EU Member States), in the case of tripartite transactions, imports and zero-rated supplies of goods outside the territory of the European Union.

In the **VAT Posting Setup menu**, the following settings are made for the new groups:

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image61.png" width="624" height="120" />

A combination of **VAT Business Posting Group** of suppliers from Bulgaria and the new **VAT Product Posting Groups** is selected. The fields are filled in as follows:
-   **VAT Business Posting Group --** Supplier from Bulgaria**;**
-   **VAT calculation type --** VAT**;**
-   **VAT % -** 0**;**
-   **Purchases VAT Account --** xxxxx**;**
-   **Transaction Type -- Purchases;**
-   **Document with header info only --** Yes**;**
-   **Specific Purchase Art.163a -** 01 or 02
-   **VAT Classification Code --** 00**;**

If posting of the supply is directly to a general ledger account, you need to change the **VAT Product Posting Group** in the line of the purchase document.

When you purchase an item that is set up as waste or cereals, the document must be included in the VAT ledger without amount.

### Reverse charge protocol 

For reverse charge protocols, a new combination needs to be added that includes a **VAT Product Posting Group**.

In the **VAT Posting Setup**, the following settings are made for the new groups:

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image62.png" width="626" height="118" />

A combination of **VAT Business Posting Group** for VAT protocols and the new **VAT Product Posting Groups** is selected. The fields are filled in as follows:
-   **VAT calculation type --** Full VAT**;**
-   **VAT % -** 20**;**
-   **Sales VAT Account --** xxxxx**;**
-   **Purchases VAT Account --** xxxxx**;**
-   **VAT Refund Account --** xxxxx**;**
-   **Transaction Type --** Total**;**
-   **Specific Purchase Art.163а --** 01 or 02**;**
-   **VAT Classification Code --** 02**;**

A new **\"Ground for Issue\"** of a reverse charge protocol is entered - **\"VAT reverse charge Art.163a (2) of the VAT Act\"**, as well as a new **\"Ground for Non-issue of VAT\"** - **\"VAT reverse charge Art.163a (2) of the VAT Act"**.

**Note:** When posting a Protocol for waste or cereals, you need to change the **VAT Product Posting Group** along the lines. If not changed, the protocol will be displayed in the ledger without the required details.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image63.png" width="476" height="232" />

# Intrastat

Intrastat is the system for collecting information on Intra-Community dispatches and / or arrivals of goods made between the Republic of Bulgaria and the EU Member States. Companies obliged to submit Intrastat declarations, namely, Intrastat operators, are those companies registered under the Value Added Tax Act, who carry out Intra-European Union trade with goods in annual volumes of  a value above the declaration thresholds. Intrastat operators are obliged to submit a monthly Intrastat declaration.

Below are some standard features of the system, as well as additions to the Localization package for Bulgaria, which help with Intrastat reporting.

## Intrastat Setup

The data required for Intrastat declarations are reduced to the fields below. Some of the data can be set in advance and filled in by default in the documents.
  

Example:

| Country/Region Code  | Country/Region of Origin Code |  Transaction Type |  Transport Method |  Shpt. Method Code |  Area  | Transport Country/Region Code |  Quantity  | Net Weight  | Amount  | Tariff No. |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ------ | ----------------------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------- | -----------|
|  DE                  |  DE                           |   11              |   3               |   CPT              |   VAR  |  DE                           |   3        |  10         |  250    |  90184990  |
  
### General Setup

The following fields are entered in advance in the **Vendor card**:
-   **Country/Region code**
-   **Shipment Method Code**
-   **Transaction Type**
-   **Transport Method**

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image64.png" width="627" height="327" />

They are transferred to the purchase order if they have been entered for the respective vendor selected in the order.

In the **Item** card, the following fields are filled in:
-   **Country/Region of Origin Code**
-   **Net Weight**
-   **Tariff No.**

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image65.png" width="627" height="319" />

In the **Purchase Order**, the following fields are filled in:
-   **Area** -- for arrivals, this is a region (district) in Bulgaria
-   **Transport Country/Region Code -** Nationality of the means of transport (You must specify the 2-character alphabetical  codе of the country whose carrier is used to transport the goods. The specified code may be that of any of the countries in the Geonomenclature.)

It is advisable that these fields be filled in the purchase order before its posting. The data can be found in the **Foreign Trade** tab of the Purchase Order.
 

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image66.png" width="627" height="406" />
 

In the **VAT Reports Configuration** page, you need to set the relevant settings once.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image67.png" width="627" height="102" />

-   **VAT Report Type** -- Intrastat Report
-   **VAT Report Version** -- 2020
-   **Suggest Lines Codeunit ID** -- 46026517 or 60013 (FTS Get Intrastat Entries)
-   **Content Codeunit ID** -- 46026519 or 60015 (FTS Export Intrastat XML)
-   **Validate Codeunit ID** -- 46026518 or 60014 (FTS Check Intrastat Error)

In the **Intrastat Setup** page, the following settings are set:

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image68.png" width="436" height="283" />

-   **Report Receipts** -- to be checked if needed to generate a declaration for receipts only
-   **Report Shipments** -- to be checked if needed to generate a declaration for shipments only
-   **Default Transport Type --** specify the default transaction type for shipping notes and purchase receipts (11 Standard Purchase / Sale)
-   **Default Transport Type -- Returns --** specify the default transaction type for the return of shipping notes and purchase receipts (11 Standard Purchase / Sale)
-   **No Item Charges in Intrastat --** if checked, the system does not allow the additional cost to be included in the amounts for Intrastat transactions

The system has built-in checks for filling in the Intrastat required fields when posting an EU document and the document includes an item. In the Intrastat declaration the data for the Tariff No. and Net Weight is taken from the Item Card, and the Country of Origin - from the Purchase Receipt and the Sales Shipment.

The Item Country of Origin is transferred to these documents from the Item Card, but it can be changed in them. If not entered in the Receipt or Shipment documents, the country code will not enter the ledger either.

### Checkmark countries, subject to Intrastat declarations 

When filling in an Intrastat declaration, a nomenclature of countries and territories is used, or the so called Geonomenclature, according to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1197.

In Dynamics 365 Business central in the page **Countries/Regions** against each country you must fill in the corresponding code for Intrastat.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image69.png" width="627" height="134" />

Subject to Intrastat declaration are the entries for items that are delivered / sold to counterparties of a country with an Intrastat code in the table of countries (regardless of the country of origin of the items).

### Intrastat nomenclatures

In Finance - Setup - Intrastat, there are all specific nomenclatures that are used in generating an Intrastat declaration. Because they are part of the standard Dynamics 365 Business Central package, completing and setting them up is not covered in this documentation.

These nomenclatures can also be found by typing part of the name in the Search field on the main menu.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image70.png" width="505" height="400" />

### Setup of Item charges included in the amounts of Intrastat declaration

The Localization package for Bulgaria allows you to set the item charge as part of the value in the Intrastat declaration.

On the Item Charge page, the following columns should be marked:

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image71.png" width="557" height="243" />

-   **Include in Intrastat amount** -- must be checked if we want the item charge to be included in the column Amount
-   **Include in Intrastat statistic value** -- must be checked if we want the item charge to be included in column Statistical value

On the **Shipment Methods** page, check this method, for which the cost of transport is included in the amount for Intrastat.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image72.png" width="627" height="185" />

In Purchases & payables setup the field **Intrastat Journal incl. Item charge**, must be marked if we want the item charge to be added to the amount for Intrastat.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image73.png" width="627" height="311" />

## Creating a new Intrastat journal


Intrastat journals are created from page **Intrastat Journals** in the main menu of the role center **Accountant**.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image74.png" width="627" height="219" />

After pressing the button **New** we should fill in the name of the journal and the statistical period for which it is created.

The statistical period is entered by first recording the last two digits of the year and then the month for which the declaration will be submitted. Example for Statistical period: 2011 - November 2020.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image75.png" width="626" height="90" />

### Generating entries in Intrastat journal

After the journal is created, the **Suggest Lines** action is selected. The system generates lines with items. These are the entries marked as \"Intrastat transaction\" and for which the Country / Region Code field contains codes indicated as Intrastat Code in the country table, regardless of the country of origin of the item.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image76.png" width="627" height="161" />

 
It is necessary to check for missing data. If there are any, they can be filled in manually in the journal. The other option is to fill them in the relevant cards (items, vendors, etc.), and then run the Suggest Line action again. It is recommended for the items to be filled in with net weights and tariff numbers (in their cards) in advance. Without these fields, the declaration will not be submitted correctly.

In the table Item Ledger Entries there are some additional fields related to Intrastat transactions such as - tariff number, customs declaration, net weight, country of origin, country of transport, method of transport, etc. They can be used for additional reporting.

It is advisable to check the value of the declaration as well. The following check is possible: In Item Ledger entries items to be filtered by the respective posting period, Record type (Purchase) and by Country / region code (\<\> '' & \<\> BG). The column Cost amount (actual) is compared with the value of the declaration - Statistical value.

The amount in Cost amount (actual) includes transport costs, if such are allocated as item charges in purchase orders.

### Generating files for Intrastat declaration

Once the data has been verified, the export is performed using the **Create File** button.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image77.png" width="627" height="189" />

**Contact Person** details must be entered:

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image78.png" width="626" height="234" />

The declaration is exported in two steps:

First step - in the field Declaration description select **Receipts** and then select the **OK** button.

Second step - in the field Declaration description select **Shipments** and then select the **OK** button.

The generated files can be found in the Downloads folder on your computer.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image79.png" width="634" height="573" />

The localization also allows only transaction files to be created, which can be uploaded after that into the Intrastat program and the declaration can be submitted from there. In this case, the **Export transactions only** option is used. The system generates import and export files (in two steps) that can be imported into the software product of the tax administration from which to create the declaration.

If the declarations must include a statistical value, the **Export Statistical Value** option is also marked.

#  Finances -- localization settings

The Localization package for Bulgaria supports additional functionalities that upgrade the main Finance module in Dynamics 365 Business Central.

## Automatic Create Default Dimensions

Every time you create a new customer or vendor, the automatic creation of dimension helps to enter the value of dimensions.

To set up this you need:
-   to search in the **General Ledger Setup** menu
-   to complete in **Create Default Dimensions** section:
    -   **Table Customer** - in the Dimension field select Dimension for Customer (it must be created in advance).
    -   **Table Vendor** in the Dimension field select Dimension for Vendor (it must be created in advance).

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image80.png" width="624" height="216" />

When you create a new customer or vendor card, the system automatically generates value in dimensions with the code and name of that customer or vendor. When you change the name in customer / vendor card, it also changes in the dimensions.

When you create a new customer or vendor, the system automatically adds the created dimension to their cards. When the customer or vendor is used in transactions, dimension is copied along the lines. This allows the generation of detailed reports and Analysis by dimensions.

## General Journal 

The following fields have been added to the General Journal:

-   SAD No. -- related to the option to post customs declarations;
-   **VAT Subject** -- the description of the transaction (good or service) is filled in which is reflected in the **VAT Purch. Ledger List** in the column **VAT description**. If left blank, it will be filled in with the value of **VAT description of purchases** field from page **BG, VAT and VIES setup**

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image81.png" width="626" height="195" />

## Trial Balance Register 

The Trial Balance Register report is a further developed report, which serves to present the data on accounts in a way that makes it easy to track the opening balance, the turnover for the respective period (debit and credit) and the closing balance.

You can start the report from the main screen of the Accountant Role Center:

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image82.png" width="627" height="172" />

or by searching the menu:

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image83.png" width="627" height="208" />

When the report is started, select the following options:

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image84.png" width="440" height="456" />

-   **From Date** -- start date of the period
-   **To Date** -- end date of the period
-   **Include Closing** -- if you want to include records after closing of accounts
-   **Type** -- Synthetic or Analytic. The Synthetic Trial Balance shows the accounts of the Total type, when similar accounts have been set up in the Chart of accounts. For example, if several accounts from group 602 have been entered and account 60290 has been created as a totaling account, which is specified as of Total type, and the Indent function was used for the summation (begin-total -- end-total), then only account 60290 will be displayed in the report. Account 60290 will not be displayed in the Analytic Trial Balance, but all accounts included in the summation.
-   **Additional Currency** -- specified when an additional reporting currency is used
-   **For export (no lines)** -- lines are not printed in the report

Additionally, selected accounts can be specified in the **Filter: Account** section.

Upon confirmation by pressing the View button, the report is displayed on the screen:

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image85.png" width="470" height="430" />

## Fixed assets

In addition to the reports in the Fixed Asset module, the Localization package for Bulgaria also provides reports developed for tax and accounting depreciation plans.

The **Changes in Fixed Asset** report contains all the information needed for Tax depreciation plan and Accounting depreciation plan. It is found in the main screen of the Accountant Role Center:

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image86.png" width="627" height="171" />

or by searching the menu:

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image87.png" width="434" height="149" />

The following options in the report must be filled in:

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image88.png" width="347" height="363" />

-   **Depreciation book** -- Depreciation book is selected -- accounting or tax;
-   **Start Date** -- start date of the period;
-   **End Date** -- end date of the period;

## Sales protocol

Like Sales invoices, Sales protocols have a list of unposted protocols.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image121.png" width="448" height="253" />

The protocol is displayed as a sales invoice, but it is in a separate list and is marked as protocol.

Once posted the protocols are stored in the list of posted invoices and can be identified as Sales protocols by the check in the Sales Protocol field. Their number series for posting must not coincide with these of invoices. Filling them in is similar to filling in a Sales invoice. This type of document is presented under code 81 in the VAT sales ledger.

The protocol is printed in a similar printed form like the Invoice, but is titled Sales protocol.

## Cancel Sales invoices or credit memos 

If you need to cancel a sales document, you must open the posted document and select **Voiding invoice** from the **Actions -- Voiding Invoice** menu**.**

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image123.png" width="627" height="292" />

The system displays a page where you must enter the **Cancellation date**. Confirm by pressing the **Close** button.

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image124.png" width="414" height="187" />

The system displays the following message:

<img src="/D365BC_BGLocalization/en/media/image125.png" width="494" height="177" />

Upon pressing the **Yes** button, the document is marked as cancelled by the system. It will appear in the VAT Sales Ledger with zero value. To reverse the G/L postings, you must issue a Credit memo or Invoice which you must also cancel.
